# Air-Quality-in-Hyderabad

As with any large city, the main cause of pollution within the city centre is vehicles. Sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were the main chemicals discovered in the air. Particulate matter was also recorded in four measurable sizes PM2.5. PM10, black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC).

## About Dataset (Overview)
The dataset contains 72 rows and 11 columns, offering a comprehensive view of air quality in Hyderabad City. It includes data on pollutants such as PM10, SO2, NOx, PM2.5

## Summary of the insights 

**PM 10 (Particulate Matter 10):**

The current value of 88 μg/m³ indicates relatively better air quality compared to the mean (110.9) and median (104.5) values. However, it still exceeds the WHO's guideline of 50 μg/m³ for 24-hour exposure, suggesting potential health risks.

**SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide):**

The current value of 13 μg/m³ suggests relatively lower concentrations of SO2 compared to the mean (16.8) and median (14.1) values, indicating better air quality within acceptable limits.

**NOx (Nitrogen Oxides):**

The current value of 34.5 μg/m³ is higher than the mean (30.2) and median (29.8), indicating relatively higher NOx levels and potentially poorer air quality.

**PM 2.5 (Particulate Matter 2.5):**

The current value of 72 μg/m³ exceeds both the mean (46.7) and median (47), indicating worse air quality with elevated levels of PM 2.5, exceeding the WHO's guideline of 25 μg/m³ for 24-hour exposure.

**Ammonia:**

The current value of 15 μg/m³ suggests relatively lower concentrations compared to the mean (24) and median (23), but without specific threshold limits, a comprehensive evaluation of air quality related to ammonia is challenging.

**O3 (Ozone):**

The current value of 16.5 μg/m³ is lower than the mean (27.8) and median (20.75), indicating relatively better air quality regarding O3 levels. However, further context and threshold limits are necessary for a comprehensive assessment.

**CO (Carbon Monoxide):**

The current value of 1.39 mg/m³ exceeds the mean (0.5497) and median (0.5), indicating higher CO levels and potentially poorer air quality. However, it is important to note that the current value is significantly lower than the WHO's guideline of 10 mg/m³ for 8-hour exposure, indicating that the air quality related to CO is within acceptable limits according to the WHO's standards.

**Benzene:**

The current value of 0.04 μg/m³ suggests relatively lower concentrations compared to the mean (0.225) and median (0.2). However, without specific threshold limits, evaluating the air quality related to benzene accurately is challenging.

**AQI (Air Quality Index):**

The current value of 162 is higher than the mean (106.2) and median (103.8), indicating poorer overall air quality and a greater risk to human health due to the combined effects of multiple pollutants.

## Air Quality Index (AQI) Observations
## Seasonal Analysis

- AQI is higher at the beginning and end of the year, indicating poorer air quality during those periods.

- AQI is lower from June to September, suggesting better air quality during these months.

- There is no significant difference in AQI across different years, except for a large variance observed during 2022, indicating potential fluctuations in air pollution levels.


# Summary of the insights:

1. **PM 10:** Moderate positive correlation (0.33) with AQI. Higher levels contribute to poorer air quality.





2. **SO2:** Weak positive correlation (0.025) with AQI. Limited impact on air quality.




3. **NOx:** Moderate positive correlation (0.23) with AQI. Higher levels indicate poorer air quality.




4. **PM 2.5:** Strong positive correlation (0.56) with AQI. Higher concentrations result in increased AQI values and potential health risks.




5. **Ammonia:** Weak negative correlation (-0.089) with AQI. Limited association with air quality.




6. **O3:** Moderate positive correlation (0.36) with AQI. Higher levels contribute to increased AQI values and potentially poorer air quality.




7. **CO:** Moderate positive correlation (0.53) with AQI. Elevated concentrations indicate poorer air quality.




8. **Benzene:** Weak positive correlation (0.14) with AQI. Limited impact, but can contribute to higher AQI values.



These concise insights highlight the correlations between pollutants and AQI, emphasizing the significant impact of PM 2.5 and CO, while noting the limited influence of SO2, ammonia, and benzene on overall air quality.


# Insights on Air Quality and AQI Trends

Based on the data available, there has been a consistent improvement in air quality over time, as indicated by the Air Quality Index (AQI) since 2017. This improvement is a positive sign that efforts to combat air pollution have been effective.

However, a concerning trend emerged in July 2022 when there was a sudden increase in AQI, reaching the highest level recorded since 2017. This indicates a potential deterioration in air quality during that period, which requires immediate attention and action.

The primary factors responsible for this increase in AQI were higher levels of carbon monoxide (CO) and elevated concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during the last few months of 2022. Identifying and addressing the sources of these pollutants is crucial for maintaining and further improving air quality.

Measures should be taken to analyze and control emissions from various sources, such as industrial activities, vehicular traffic, and biomass burning, which are known contributors to CO and PM2.5 levels. Implementation of effective policies and regulations will be essential to mitigate these pollutants and ensure sustainable air quality improvement.
